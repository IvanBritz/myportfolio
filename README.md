Selected Film: Inception (2010, directed by Christopher Nolan)

1. Story Elements (25 points)

Premise: A skilled thief enters dreams to steal secrets but is given a chance at redemption if he can implant an idea instead of stealing one.

Backstory: Dom Cobb lost his wife, Mal, and is on the run from authorities. His only way home to his children is to succeed in the “inception” mission.

Synopsis: Cobb assembles a team of dream manipulators to plant an idea into a business heir’s mind through layered dreams.

Theme: Reality vs. illusion; guilt and redemption; manipulation of perception.

Setting: Shifting dream worlds (cities folding, zero-gravity hotels, snowy fortresses) and real-world locations (Paris, Tokyo, Los Angeles).

Plot: Player must navigate missions inside layered dreams, balancing time, environment manipulation, and survival while preventing the subconscious “projections” from eliminating them.

Balancing Conflict: Internal (Cobb’s grief and guilt) vs. External (mission threats, dream collapses, enemy projections).

Shifting Focus: Between action combat, stealth infiltration, and puzzle-solving to stabilize dream worlds.

Suspension of Disbelief: The game emphasizes the science-fiction rules of dream-sharing while maintaining player immersion in surreal but logical environments.

Realism: Weapons, physics, and human emotions feel grounded, but dream manipulation introduces fantastical abilities.
