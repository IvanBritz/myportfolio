Movie-to-Game Adaptation: Interstellar (2014)
1. Story Elements (25 points)

Premise: A group of astronauts travels through a wormhole to find a new habitable planet for humanity, as Earth is dying from environmental collapse.

Backstory: Humanity faces extinction due to global crop failures and dust storms. Former NASA pilot Cooper is recruited for a last-hope mission.

Synopsis: Players (as Cooper or custom crew) must explore different planets across galaxies, manage limited resources, survive harsh environments, and make moral choices to save humanity.

Theme: Love, sacrifice, hope, survival, and the clash between human instincts and scientific reasoning.

Setting: Earth (dying farmland), NASA base, outer space, wormhole, different planets (water world, ice world, desert world), and a black hole environment.

Plot (Game Version):

Survive on Earth (resource gathering, early dust storms).

Join NASA mission → prepare spacecraft & crew.

Travel through the wormhole.

Explore multiple hostile planets with unique gameplay mechanics (water planet – flood survival, ice planet – navigation, desert planet – resource scarcity).

Enter the black hole (time-dilation puzzle mechanics).

Return with critical data to save humanity.

Balancing Conflict: Players face external conflicts (hostile environments, limited supplies, time constraints) and internal conflicts (family ties, moral decisions).

Shifting Focus: From exploration → survival → puzzle-solving → emotional story choices.

Suspension of Disbelief: Wormholes, relativity, and black hole science are explained realistically but still allow game-like mechanics.

Realism: Accurate physics (gravity/time effects), survival mechanics (oxygen, fuel, food), mixed with cinematic storytelling.

2. Characters (25 points)

Hero / Protagonist:

Joseph Cooper – skilled pilot and loving father determined to save humanity and return to his children.

Shadow (Antagonist):

Dr. Mann – betrays the mission out of fear and selfishness, representing human weakness.

Mentor:

Professor Brand (Michael Caine) – guides the team with his scientific expertise and moral advice.

Ally:

Amelia Brand – scientist and astronaut, supportive and driven by hope and love.

TARS & CASE (AI robots) – provide comic relief, technical support, and combat assistance.

Guardian:

Harsh environments of space and planets – testing survival at every turn.

Trickster:

TARS – provides humor and sarcasm but also creative problem-solving.

Herald:

NASA’s mission call, offering Cooper the chance to save his family and humanity.

Transformational Characters:

Cooper – grows from a reluctant farmer into a selfless savior.

Amelia Brand – evolves from a scientist following orders to one led by love and hope.

Mistaken Characters:

Dr. Mann – believed to be humanity’s best hope, but becomes a dangerous liability.

Exaggerated Characters:

The forces of nature (waves, ice storms, black hole) – heightened to challenge players dramatically.

Supporting Characters:

Murphy Cooper (Coop’s daughter, critical to solving the equation).

NASA staff and minor astronauts.

✅ This adaptation could be a story-driven survival exploration game similar to No Man’s Sky + The Last of Us style of emotional storytelling.
