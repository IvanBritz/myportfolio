Movie-to-Game Adaptation: Interstellar (2014)
1. Story Elements (25 points)

Premise: A group of astronauts travels through a wormhole to find a new habitable planet for humanity, as Earth is dying from environmental collapse.

Backstory: Humanity faces extinction due to global crop failures and dust storms. Former NASA pilot Cooper is recruited for a last-hope mission.

Synopsis: Players (as Cooper or custom crew) must explore different planets across galaxies, manage limited resources, survive harsh environments, and make moral choices to save humanity.

Theme: Love, sacrifice, hope, survival, and the clash between human instincts and scientific reasoning.

Setting: Earth (dying farmland), NASA base, outer space, wormhole, different planets (water world, ice world, desert world), and a black hole environment.

Plot (Game Version):

Survive on Earth (resource gathering, early dust storms).

Join NASA mission → prepare spacecraft & crew.

Travel through the wormhole.

Explore multiple hostile planets with unique gameplay mechanics (water planet – flood survival, ice planet – navigation, desert planet – resource scarcity).

Enter the black hole (time-dilation puzzle mechanics).

Return with critical data to save humanity.

Balancing Conflict: Players face external conflicts (hostile environments, limited supplies, time constraints) and internal conflicts (family ties, moral decisions).

Shifting Focus: From exploration → survival → puzzle-solving → emotional story choices.

Suspension of Disbelief: Wormholes, relativity, and black hole science are explained realistically but still allow game-like mechanics.

Realism: Accurate physics (gravity/time effects), survival mechanics (oxygen, fuel, food), mixed with cinematic storytelling.

✅ This adaptation could be a story-driven survival exploration game similar to No Man’s Sky + The Last of Us style of emotional storytelling.

Would you like me to also do the same breakdown for another movie (like John Wick or The Matrix) so you’ll have two complete activity answers ready?

Gladiator

Perfect ⚔️ Gladiator (2000) is another excellent choice because it blends action, drama, and history — making it great for an action–adventure or RPG-style game. Here’s the full breakdown for your activity:
